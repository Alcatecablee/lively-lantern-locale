Comprehensive Automated Fixing System
NeuroLint is a multi layer automated code fixing system designed to detect and solve common issues in React/Next.js codebases. It’s modular, fast, and ready to be extended by the engineering community.

🚀 Quick Start
# Run all fixes automatically
npm run fix all

# Preview what would be fixed (dry run)
npm run fix dry run

# Run with detailed output
npm run fix verbose

# Run individual layers
npm run fix layer 1  # Configuration fixes
npm run fix layer 2  # Pattern fixes
npm run fix layer 3  # Component fixes
npm run fix layer 4  # Hydration fixes
🔧 System Architecture
Layer 1: Configuration Fixes   Modernizes configs and dependencies.
Layer 2: Bulk Pattern Fixes   Cleans up code, solves HTML/entity/import issues.
Layer 3: Component Specific Fixes   Ensures React/TS component best practices.
Layer 4: Hydration/SSR Fixes   Guards against SSR errors, adds NoSSR patterns.
📊 Usage Examples
# Preview changes without applying them
npm run fix dry run

# Skip specific layers
node scripts/fix master.js   skip layers 1,2

# Verbose output for debugging
npm run fix verbose
🛡️ Safety Features
Dry Run Mode & backups
Incremental, layer by layer execution
Error recovery and build validation
🎯 Common Fix Patterns
HTML Entities: &quot; → "
Missing Key Props: <div> → <div key={item.id}>
Button Variants: <Button> → <Button variant="default">
TS Config: "target": "es5" → "target": "ES2020"
SSR Guards: localStorage → typeof window !== "undefined" && localStorage
📈 Performance
Each layer runs in seconds. Complete runs usually finish in under a minute, making this suitable for CI or local workflows.

🔧 Customization and Contributing
